# Full stack evidence of ecological disaster 
This is my final assignment for the Dynamic Web Development class in ITP, NYU. The course focuses on the fundamentals of building "full stack" web applications. 

## About
I am coming from Russia and believe that in my country ecological disasters of different kinds usually don't get necessary coverage in the media space, causing a lot of people suffer from the consequences, sometimes for years, most of the times unwillingly and unknowingly. 

I personally experienced this 'phenomena'. When my mother was pregnant with me she lived in the area with exceedence of the fluorin maximum allowable concentration in water, which finally affected me and my health as a child.

Th problem is even deeper. There is very often the lack of reliable data around many ecological issues, such as: landfill sites about the size of the cities (both illegal and legal ones), giant 'storages' of chemical wastes, massive understatement of the ecological catastrophes (explosions, etc.), wrong or no statistics on cases of diseases caused by emissions of harmful substances and fumes. 

So, I am making the tool to collect the data on the harmful causes of such cases. 

MVP looks as follows — the interactive map of the area around small Russian town [Shatura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shatura) not far from Moscow. Residents are protesting against the semi-legal landfill site located within town' boundaries next to school and kindergarten, so that they can literally smell its fumes.

I focused on Shature because I was able to find [results of the inspection on the ecological situation in the town](https://e-ecolog.ru/reestr/doc/1317700) which shows the exceedings of the hydrogen sulphide, formaldehyde, nitrogen dioxide, dimethylbenzene (xylene) — to begin with. All of the mentioned substances cause serious diseases.

I would like to give people living around potentially dangerous areas to upload the evidence if they have been diagnosed with any of the illnesses that are most likely to be caused by the dangerous neighbourhood. 

However, this is the most challenging part of the projects. I would like people to be only able to upload RELIABLE DATA, and at the same time stay ANONYMOUS and SAFE which is relevant to the current political situation in my homeland. If I succeed even just a little, we'll get the tool that might be used to collect data on different controversial subjects including elections or confirmed coronavirus cases.

I am developing this project within the frameworks of 'Designing meaningful interactions', 'Dynamic Web Development', 'Nature of code', and 'Maths for artists' classes at Interactive Telecommunications Program, NYU.
